## The business challenges
B2BStore solves a set of key business challenges from the world of the shopping experience. Our goal is to provide the solution with:

- smooth shopping experience close to the user experience from the native mobile applications;
- all-in-one front-end for desktop and mobile screens with no necessity for maintaining 3 or more applications for different touchpoints (web browser, Android, iOS, etc.).
- rapid development without architecture limitations.

It offers all the PWA Studio capabilities adding, on top of those, B2B core fearures rspecting same architecture (PWA, ReactJS, headless, graphQL) and development practices.
